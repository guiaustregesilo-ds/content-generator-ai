# MARKETING DEPARTMENT – Clínica Essencial Saúde

You have received an email request from Clínica Essencial Saúde, which offers care in various medical specialties (general clinic, cardiology, gynecology, pediatrics, etc.) as well as services from nutritionists, psychologists, and physiotherapists.

“Our clinic has a website with a blog and social media, but content production has been rather infrequent. Although we have a good number of patients, we want to strengthen our digital presence and educate the public with content that brings authority and engagement.

However, our medical team does not have time to write, and when we use ChatGPT manually, we struggle to maintain tone consistency and also end up spending too much time choosing and refining prompts. Moreover, the marketing manager is always busy with other demands and therefore often overloaded.

We need a practical solution so that, from a given topic or subject, optimized content for SEO can be generated and adapted for different platforms or channels such as Instagram, blog, and email.
We need something flexible and customizable that delivers consistent results, so our employees don’t waste time writing or testing prompts.”
